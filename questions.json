    "question": "Explain the virtual DOM in React and how it improves performance",
    "answer": "The virtual DOM is a JavaScript representation of the actual DOM. React uses it to optimize rendering by comparing the virtual DOM tree with the previous version (diffing) and only updating the parts that have changed (reconciliation). This reduces expensive DOM operations and improves performance.",

    "question": "What are React Hooks and why were they introduced?",
    "answer": "React Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. They were introduced to solve problems like wrapper hell, huge components, and confusing classes. Hooks like useState, useEffect, and useContext make code more reusable and easier to test.",

    "answer": "A closure is when a function has access to variables from its outer scope even after the outer function has returned.\n\nExample:\nfunction outer() {\n  let count = 0;\n  return function inner() {\n    count++;\n    return count;\n  };\n}\nThe inner function has access to 'count' even after outer() finishes executing.",

    "question": "What is database indexing and why is it important?",
    "answer": "Database indexing creates a data structure that improves query performance by providing faster access paths to data. Like a book index, it points to where data is located without scanning the entire table. Indexes speed up SELECT queries but can slow down INSERT/UPDATE operations.",
